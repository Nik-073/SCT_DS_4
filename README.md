🚦 Traffic Accident Data Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing traffic accident data to identify patterns based on:

Road Conditions (e.g., wet, dry, icy)

Weather Factors (e.g., rain, fog, snow)

Time of Day (e.g., morning, afternoon, night)

The goal is to uncover key accident hotspots and contributing risk factors, helping improve road safety and awareness.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze accident frequency across different weather and road conditions

Identify peak accident hours

Detect high-risk locations / hotspots

Visualize accident trends and patterns for easy interpretation

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Category	Tools / Libraries
Programming	Python
Data Handling	pandas, numpy
Visualization	matplotlib, seaborn, plotly (optional)
Geospatial (if using location data)	folium / geopandas
📂 Project Workflow

Data Import & Cleaning

Handle missing values

Convert date and time columns

Standardize weather/road condition labels

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Accident distribution by weather, road condition, time of day

Peak accident hours and days

Hotspot Identification

Group by Latitude & Longitude / Street / City

Highlight most accident-prone areas

Data Visualization

Bar charts: Accidents by weather & road condition

Line plots: Hourly/weekly trend

Heatmaps / Geo Maps: Accident hotspots

📊 Example Visuals (to include once completed)

📈 Accidents vs Time of Day

🌧️ Weather-wise Accident Counts

🛣️ Road Condition Comparison

🗺️ Heatmap of Accident Hotspots

✅ Expected Insights

Most accidents occur during evening rush hours

Rainy / foggy weather significantly increases accident risk

Specific intersections or highways may show frequent accident clusters
